Social Butterfly
================
A prototype chat application coded for fun. Really a learning exercise for Meteor.js.

Currently hosted on [http://socialbutterfly.meteor.com/](http://socialbutterfly.meteor.com/).

Chat window will roll over after 50 messages just in case you type something in that's embarrassing.
No email signup necessary, just plop in a username and password and you're ready to go!
